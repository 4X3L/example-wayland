/* The confusing thing about wayland is that there are two main parts, a 
   "meta-protocol" that can be used to define a "concrete-protocol" that the client
   and server use to communicate. Because of this things like, 
   "wl_registry_add_listener" and "wl_registry_bind" do not have definitions in 
   wayland-client.h. Instead, they are found in an xml file in "protocol/wayland.xml"
   in the wayland source code. The "meta-protocol" then uses this xml file to 
   generate a concrete protocol that our client will use to actually communicate 
   with the server. The only thing the "meta-protocol" provides is a way to 
   communicate with the server, what is communicated is specified by 
   "concrete-protocol". 

   Despite being written in C the concrete protocol is actually an object oriented 
   protocol. The objects in the protocol are called "interfaces" The general form of 
   "methods" are "<Wayland Namespace>_<Interface Name>_<Method Name>" So if we were
   to write this in C++ this:

   struct wl_registry *registry = wl_display_get_registry(...);
   wl_registry_bind(registry, ...);

   would look like this:
   
   wl::registry reg = display.get_registry(...);
   reg.bind(...); 
   
   The order of parameters in a method is:
   Object pointer, ... Protocol Specific Params ... , Protocol Version Number
